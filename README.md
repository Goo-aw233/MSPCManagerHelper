## 💻 Development

1. Download Python 3.11 from [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)

2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goo-aw233/MSPCManagerHelper.git
cd MSPCManagerHelper
```

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

- **Windows**: 

```Batch
cd <path\to\MSPCManagerHelper>
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

<details>

<summary>The <code>install_requirements.sh</code> for macOS and Linux is no longer available</summary>

- **macOS / Linux**: 

```bash
cd <path/to/MSPCManagerHelper>
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</details>

4. Install the pip Packages

```Batch
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install requests
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

In the `scripts` directory, you can also run `install_requirements.bat` directly to quickly complete the installation, or run `install_requirements_.venv.bat` to activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies at the same time.

5. Build the EXE

Run `build.bat` or `build_.venv.bat` directly from the `scripts\build` directory to build it yourself.
Finally, the built `EXE file` will be stored in the `dist` directory of the root directory and named `MSPCManager_... _vx.x.x.x.x.exe`.
