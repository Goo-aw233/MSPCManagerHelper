## 💻 Development

1. Download Python 3.11 from [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)

2. Clone the code

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Goo-aw233/MSPCManagerHelper.git
    cd MSPCManagerHelper
    ```

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

    - **Windows**:

        ```Batch
        py -3.11 -m venv .venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    <details>
    <summary>The <code>install_requirements.sh</code> for macOS and Linux is no longer available</summary>

    - **macOS / Linux**:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

    </details>

4. Install the pip Packages

    ```Batch
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install requests
    ```

    In the `scripts` directory, you can also run `install_requirements.bat` directly to quickly complete the installation, or run `install_requirements_.venv.bat` to activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies at the same time.

5. Build the EXE

    Run `build.bat` or `build_.venv.bat` directly from the `scripts\build` directory to build it yourself.
    Finally, the built `EXE file` will be stored in the `dist` directory of the root directory and named `MSPCManagerHelper_... _vx.x.x.x.x.exe`.
